# my_repo


## A collection of programs I have made during my spare time as a demonstrator of my coding skills. Mainly in C# and C++.

- PIano (C#): Plays a piano song based on the digits of pi.

- Monte Pilo (C++): Calculates an approximation of pi using a Monte Carlo simulation.

- ClockHands (C#): Calculates the angle between the hands on a clock at a specified time.

- METAR decoder (WIP) (C#): Decodes METAR weather data (with in-built airport database)

- Vending Machine (C#): Simulates a vending machine (and storing of coins but not items)
